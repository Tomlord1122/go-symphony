# Go Symphony
Inspired by [go-blueprint](https://github.com/Melkeydev/go-blueprint), I want to create a useful tool that helps myself and others to create new projects with popular frameworks. I personally love to use Chi, PostgreSQL, Redis for my backend projects and Svelte for my frontend projects. 

I am still learning Web Development, especially the deployment part. This project will gradually add the configurations I think are useful.


## Next up


1. Support for GORM.
2. Integration with Svelte Frontend Framework.
3. Add Advanced Docker and Kubernetes support.
